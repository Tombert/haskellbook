Haskell, as a language, has a bit of a loaded reputation.  

A lot of programmers assume that Haskell is that "mathey language", and once they hear mention of functors, monoids, monads, and arrows, they end up with the conclusion that it is a a tool that might have some interesting ideas, but is too academic to be suitable for any kind of practical use. 

This is an easy viewpoint to have.  There is a steep, non-trivial learning curve to the minutia of functional programming, and Haskell is among the most dogmatic of the functional languages; to understand Haskell is to understand the basics of algebra, Category Theory, Type Theory, and Set Theory.  Consequently, a lot of people assume that people learn Haskell so that they look smart.
